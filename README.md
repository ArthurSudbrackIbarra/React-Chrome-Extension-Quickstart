# React Extension Quickstart

(In the Future) => npm package to generate a quickstart template for creating Chrome extensions.

(As of Now) => Only the quickstart template files are here in this repository. The files are not "templated" yet.

## How to Use

Use the command:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then load the extension in Chrome by selecting the `build` folder generated after the command was ran.
