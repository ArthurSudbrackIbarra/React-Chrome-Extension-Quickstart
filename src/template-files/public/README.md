# Public Directory

This directory contains the public files that are served by the web server.

It also contains the `manifest.json` file that defines the extension properties.

## What to Change Here?

As said before, the `manifest.json` file defines the extension properties. In this file, you can change the extension name, description, version, and other metadata, such as permissions.
