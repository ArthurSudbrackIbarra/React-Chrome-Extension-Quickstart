# Messaging Directory

This directory contains the source code for the messaging system. The messaging system is responsible for sending and receiving messages between the child iframe, which contains your React app, and the parent window.

## What to Change Here?

There is **no need to change the classes in this directory**. Your only responsibility is to create new message types in `messageTypes.ts` to meet your needs.
